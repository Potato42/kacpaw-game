Some Automated KA Game
======================

To test the front end, run ``view-front-end.py``

To test the back end, I'm not really sure yet.  Until now I've just been messing around with ``sys.path`` to get things to work, but it will probably involve virtualenv, pip, and possibly git submodules.

Assuming I'm not the only person who will work on this game, communication will be done with issues.  Open an issue if you have a topic you want to discuss (or if there is an actual issue)

You need Python 3 (Probably 3.3+, I have 3.4) to run anything here, and you may need to ``pip install`` some stuff like jinja2.
